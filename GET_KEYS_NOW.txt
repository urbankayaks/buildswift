STRIPE API KEYS - GET THEM NOW
================================

You have Stripe dashboard open in browser. Just need to copy 2 things:

STEP 1: Make sure you're in TEST MODE
- Look at top of Stripe dashboard
- You should see toggle: "Viewing test data"
- Toggle should be ON (enabled)

STEP 2: Go to API Keys page
- Click your account name (top right)
- Click "Developers" 
- Click "API Keys"

Or just go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

STEP 3: Copy these 2 values exactly as shown

You'll see a section labeled "Standard keys" or "API Keys"

PUBLISHABLE KEY:
- Look for: "Publishable key"
- Should start with: pk_test_
- Click the copy button or select the entire value
- PASTE IT BELOW:

[ Paste pk_test_... here ]

SECRET KEY:
- Look for: "Secret key"  
- Should start with: sk_test_
- Click "Reveal" if hidden
- Click the copy button or select the entire value
- PASTE IT BELOW:

[ Paste sk_test_... here ]

That's it! Just copy those 2 values and paste them.

Once you give me those, I can:
1. Save to .env
2. Set up webhook
3. Test the full payment flow
4. Verify everything works

Takes 30 seconds total.
